            When I was in high school, we were required to take a language course for at least three full years. Being a somewhat stereotypical Texan,
            I chose to take Spanish, and had great fun doing so. I even ended up doing a three week long language trip to Seville, Spain, with a few
            teachers from my school, and learned a lot during my time there. After that trip, I took my third (and final) year of Spanish at my school. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The teacher for that class was a remarkable man - brilliant at what he taught, and even more exceptional at the teaching itself. Later in that 
            year, I found out he was actually half Japanese, and off-handedly asked him about resources for learning the language. I received a slew of helpful
            information from him, with personal anecdotes about how he learned Spanish and English, and what his approaches were to the nuances of language learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I've been fascinated with languages, namely Japanese. One of the most noteable differences Japanese has from English (besides the different
            writing system) is that Japanese has a different 
            <a title="SVO vs SOV" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb_word_order">sentence structure</a> from English.
            Combining this with other features, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography">being phonetically consistent</a> and having over 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_Kan-Wa_Jiten">50,000</a> borrowed and adapted characters from Chinese, I was very quickly absorbed into the world of
            learning this language.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, I hope you can learn a little bit more about the language I love, and browse the resources I have acquired
            in my time learning Japanese. Scroll down for something fun!
